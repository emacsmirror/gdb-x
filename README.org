#+TITLE: gdb-x.el --- Improve GDB-MI user interface
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

Extra utilities for improving the user interface of gdb-mi.el.

This package improves upon the defaults provided by =gdb-mi=.

- It ensures that sources lines to be executed are centred on the buffers displaying them.
- Restores the window configuration prior to starting the GDB session.
- Updates =hl-line= in disassembly buffers.

* Installation
Add this to your configuration file:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package gdb-x
  :straight (:type git :host codeberg :repo "shepherd/gdb-x")
  :demand t
  :general
  (:keymaps
   '(gud-mode-map gud-minor-mode-map)
   "C-c C-'" 'gdb-x-many-windows-mode
   "C-c C-q" 'gdb-x-gud-quit))
#+end_src

* Usage
Run ~gdb-x-many-windows-mode~ in a GDB session. This is meant to replace the use case of ~gdb-many-windows~.

To exit GDB use ~gdb-x-gud-quit~ bound to =C-c C-q= in ~gdb-x-many-windows-mode-map~.
